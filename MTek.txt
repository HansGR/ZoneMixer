# List of doors in Magitek Factory.  format: DoorID_RoomID(_type).  type = [d, o, i] for [2-way door, out only, in only].
# NOTE: MtekA2 is the mini platform that is part of the MtekA map.  For this to work we would need a special condition
# in ZoneWalker that forced the connection 005_MtekA2_o --> 002_MtekA_i as the first step.
# Similar forced connections could make other maps work too (e.g. in Esper Mtn 4).
# However writing the forcing code is more challenging than I expected: sometimes it works, but often it fails due to
# creating zones which it thinks are inaccessible.
